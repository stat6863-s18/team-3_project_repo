*Note: It compares Columns "contenrl_ab_2010" (Part A and B) and "contenrl_hmo" 
(HMOs) and "death_dt" from contenr2010_analytic_file. 

Limitation: We have inpatient and outpatient benefeciaries for one year (2010), 
who continiously enrolled in Medicare program. The other type of Medicare 
services are not included in our data set. We have already excluded the values
of "contenrl_ab_2010" equal to missing from this analysis. In this dataset we
have benefeciaries who are both enrolled in Medicare and HMOs services. Also,
this data set includes information about benefeciaries being enrolled in 
Medicare program but passed away in 2010.

Methodology: Use proc freq to display percentage of continiously enrolled alive 
benefeciaries in Part A and Part B and Health Maintenance Organizations.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean values in order to filter out any possible
illegal values, and better handle missing data by validating extra variables
with missing data.

Methodology: Use two proc freq to display the ordered proportion of

Followup Steps: More carefully clean values in order to filter out any possible
illegal values, and better handle missing data by validating extra variables
with missing data. Adding the other type of medical services to increase the 
population of investigated benefeciaries. Use chi square test of independence

* Note: It calculates column Study_Age that contains age as of 01.01.2010. 
It also uses variable Age_cats to group benefeciaries by value of study_age
column. We calculated variable age_cats that groups study_age into the 
following age categories: < 65 years old, age between 64 and 74, 75 and 84, 85
and 94 and greater 95. It also compares the column "County" and "State" with 
the column of the bene_id and claim_id from contenr2010_analytic_file.

Limitation: We have information about inpatient and outpatient benefeciaries,
who continiously enrolled in Medicare program in 2010. The other type of 
Medicare services are excluded from the data set.

Methodology: Use proc freq to display percent of benefeciaries by study age,
proc report to display their percent for each age categories by sex,
sgplot to output a horizontal bar plot, illustrating the the percentage of 
benefeciaries by sex to show the proportion of female and male in each
age categories.

Followup Steps: Analyse the proportion of male and female benefeciaries by
race for each age categories.

Methodology: Use proc freq to display sorted percentage of benefeciaries by
state in descending order, proc sql to output the first top 5 counties with
largest benefeciary population.

Followup Steps: Analyse the frequency of benefeciaries grouped by state and 
county to see states with counties with largest senior and disabled population

Methodology: Use proc freq with chisq option to calculate chi square statistics
and p value to conduct chi square test of independence of sex and race

Followup Steps: Perform a chi-square goodness of fit test that allow us to test
whether the observed proportions for race differ from hypothesized proportions
of this categorical variable.
