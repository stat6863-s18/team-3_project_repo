  the fullstimer output in the system log, they tend to take about 0.03
  seconds of "real time" to execute and about 35 MB of memory on the computer

  the same amount of time to execute as the combined data step and proc sort
  steps above, but to use 5MB more memory;
* note to learners: Based upon these results, the proc sql step is preferable
  if memory performance isn't critical. This is because less code is required,
  so it's faster to write and verify correct output has been obtained;
