'Question: Is there a statisical difference in the proportion of patients that made zero or more than one inpatient claims by rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis status?'
;

title2 justify=left
'Rationale: This should help identify trends in hospitalization for patients with certain chronic conditions.'
;

footnote1 justify=left
'There is a statistically significant difference between the number of expected and observed claims, indicating that patients with RA or OA file more inpatient claims than their peers who do not.'
;

footnote2 justify=left
'The result of this test was highly significant, but there may be other factors driving this difference, such as age, overall general health, and/or other competing risks'
;

*Note: This compares the variable "Chronic Condition: RA/OA" in 
Master_Beneficiary_Summary_2010.csv to "Clm_ID" in 
Master_Inpatient_Claim_2010.csv.

Limitations: This question assumes that each admission is logged individually
as referenced by claim ID. This may not be acccurate.

Methodology: Use proc freq to evaluate independence of COPD_Status versus 
number of inpatient claims.

Follow-up Steps: Further investigate by including other possible covariates and/or
class variables in the analysis to determine if there are other contributing
factors.

*Note: This compares the variable "Chronic Condition: COPD" in 
Master_Beneficiary_Summary_2010.csv to "Claim Payment Amount" in

Limitations: No limitations identified during exploratory steps.

Methodology: Use proc univariate to further explore the apparent lack
of difference in claim amounts for inpatient stays based on COPD status.

Follow-up Steps: A possible follow-up to this approach could use formal 
inferential methods to compare mean and/or median values for each group 
to provide evidence of no difference in claim amounts.
